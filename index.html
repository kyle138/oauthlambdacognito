<p>In order to secure a single-page webapp hosted in S3 and backed up by Lambda/API Gateway, OAuth2 can be used with Cognito and a Web Identity Federation provider (eg: Google+, Facebook, etc). Steps 1-2 of this how-to will create a sample Lambda function served by API Gateway and secured using AWS-IAM. Steps 3-12 document the steps to allow a user to login to access the secured Lambda/API. If you already have a secured Lambda/API Gateway set up you can skip directly to Step 3 but I recommend reading through the first two Steps to understand how to secure your existing API Gateway resources.</p>
